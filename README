yoctotrace.py: Linux kernel ftrace wrapper for tracing 
               a particular Linux kernel module.

This utility provides a wrapper to Linux's debugfs.  Since the latter
filesystem is being manipulated this tool should be run with appropriate
privileges.

Yes, there are other tools like this (trace-cmd); however, I want to keep things
simple.  Only two kinds of traces, and only one can run at a time:
    1) Number of function calls
    2) Callgraph showing function timings

The output is written to a local file named 'ftrace.log.N' where N is the next
available unused number not already taken by an existing file in the current
working directory.


Example:
    // This utility runs both a count and callgraph (timing) trace.
    // Only one or the other test can be performed, not both
    // simultaneously.
    //
    // Once you desire the trace to end, issue a '--stop' or '-s' to
    // yoctotrace.py
    //
    // The results will be generated to a file named
    // ftrace.scan.N where N is a number.

    sudo ./yoctotrace.py -c -d /sys/kernel/debug -m my_awesome_module

    ... do some crap ...

    sudo ./ypctotrace.py -s
